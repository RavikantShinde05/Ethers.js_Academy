# Ethers.js_Academy 

A hands-on learning platform designed to help developers understand and master the **ethers.js** library by writing real code and seeing real results.
This project focuses on **learning by doing** you write code snippets, execute them instantly, and observe the output directly in the console.

##  About the Project

This platform helps you learn how to:
- Use **ethers.js** effectively
- Interact with the **Ethereum blockchain**
- Communicate with **smart contracts**
- Work with different **Web3 providers**

Each concept is taught through **practical code snippets**, paired with **clear explanations** so you understand *what* is happening and *why* it works.

##  Key Features

-  **Practical Learning**
  - Write ethers.js code snippets directly
  - Instantly view execution results in the console

-  **Code + Explanation**
  - Every code snippet comes with a detailed explanation
  - Learn how ethers.js interacts with the blockchain step by step

-  **Multiple Web3 Provider Support**
  - Connect using providers like:
    - Infura
    - Alchemy
    - Other JSON-RPC providers
  - Use your own **API Key** and **account address**

-  **MetaMask Integration**
  - Connect your MetaMask wallet
  - Interact with the blockchain directly from your browser
  - Send transactions and call smart contract functions

## 🔗 How It Works

1. Choose or write an ethers.js code snippet  
2. Connect a Web3 provider:
   - Via Infura / Alchemy (API Key + account address), **or**
   - By connecting your MetaMask wallet
3. Run the snippet
4. View the output in the console
5. Read the explanation to understand the logic behind the code
